    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      CAT &amp; CAMEL is an accessible, affordable, flexible, personalized, and project-based education program that helps people learn new skills from
      local experts.
    <br>
      Instead of students and teachers in a formal school system, there are
      CAMELs (Curious, Ambitious, Motivated, Excited Learner) and CATs
      (Cheerleader, Advocate, Tutor) in a fun learning community.
    <br>
      As you can tell from the name, CAT &amp; CAMEL doesn't take itself
      seriously, but as you will see from the community, it does take lifelong
      learning seriously.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Humans are naturally curious and our brains are built to learn. Everyone
      wants to learn new skills to expand their capabilities and potential.
    <br>
      Before adulthood, a general education is free to all, and during
      adulthood, education is extremely costly in terms of sacrificing both
      time and money. All throughout life, people should have accessible,
      affordable, and personalized education ‚Äî no matter their current
      expertise, age, or career. Most people who cannot sacrifice the time and
      money necessary for college, (boot)camps, and seminars need an
      alternative educational program that can be personalized to meet them
      where they're at and account for their unique life situations. They need
      an educational program that is flexible and customized to their
      schedule, location, interests, learning styles, motivations, and current
      skill level.
    <br>
      While video courses and online classes are accessible, they do not
      provide personalization to the education nor any in-the-moment or
      in-person feedback from the teacher. Therefore there is a gap between
      accessible online video education and expensive in-person university
      education that needs to be filled with an educational program that is as
      accessible as online courses and as personable as college courses.
    <br>
      Additionally, both college and online courses are designed for a general
      audience, with the expectation that the students enrolling must all be
      at the same skill level to begin with. Those courses are built with a
      specific skill level in mind ‚Äî a one size fits most approach. Therefore
      there is also a need for personalized courses that are tailored for the
      individual, meeting the learner at their skill level and beginning and
      building upon whatever base/foundation the learner has currently.
    <br>
      CAT &amp; CAMEL strives to bridge the accessibility and affordability
      gaps and fulfill these educational needs by offering flexible,
      accessible, affordable, and personalized courses. The courses are built
      based on the learner's needs and wants, priced based on the learner's
      financial situation, scheduled based on the learner's schedule, paced
      based on the learner's abilities, and customized based on the learner's
      current skill level and desired skill level.
    </p>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To help people learn new skills from local experts through affordable,
      personalized, project-based education.
    </p>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      To create a community that celebrates curiosity, lifelong learning, and
      personal passion projects in order to inspire aspiration, ambition, and
      actualization.
    </p>
    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The core of CAT &amp; CAMEL is customized courses created by both the
      tutor (CAT) and the learner (CAMEL) to fit the learner's personal needs.
      No two courses are the same. After choosing a skill to learn, the CAMEL
      finds a local CAT to work with and hire. Together they design and
      structure the course by scheduling where and when to regularly meet,
      deciding on projects and milestones, and exploring learning methods and
      materials. From there on, they follow the planned schedule and meet up
      periodically. The CAT helps, encourages, and pushes the CAMEL to learn,
      explore, and complete milestones by set deadlines. Every course ends
      when the CAMEL completes a capstone project. At this point, the CAMEL is
      given the opportunity to publicly present the capstone project at a
      showcase celebration. (While it is not required of a CAMEL, the public
      presentation is strongly encouraged.) No accredited degrees or
      certifications are given from CAT &amp; CAMEL. (Although fun fake
      certificates and stickers are offered to those who enjoy that sort of
      thing.) CAT &amp; CAMEL believes that the capstone project should be a
      self-evident demonstration of the CAMEL's capabilities ‚Äî the work proves
      the learner's skill. The capstone project is the central culmination of
      the CAMEL's progress in the course. All courses have a series of
      milestones that lead to the completion of the capstone project, and most
      courses include preliminary practice projects before beginning the final
      capstone project.
    </p>
    <h3>Group courses</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes CAMELs may wish to take the same course at the same time with
      the same CAT, whether it's a group of friends, family, partners,
      classmates, etc. In this scenario, the learners must decide if they
      would like to do one project together or individual projects on their
      own.
    </p>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>
      The objective of every course is to meet the CAMEL at her current skill
      level and determine where she would like to go / at what level she would
      like to be. From there the CAT and CAMEL plot out the course toward
      reaching that skill level. (This is the true beauty of personalized
      courses, because they can adapt to any skill level and take as long as
      necessary to bring the learner up to the level of expertise desired.)
    </p>
    <h3>Breakdown</h3>
    <h4>Who</h4>
    <p>
      CAMELs come from all walks of life. The learners can be anyone from any
      age, background, or experience. They can also take a group course
      together.
    </p>
    <h4>What</h4>
    <p>
      The course is completely personalized by/for the CAMEL and is intended
      to help the CAMEL learn a new skill or develop a skill. Every course is
      completed with a capstone project. Generally, courses have learning
      resources and materials, practice projects, and a capstone project with
      a series of milestones leading to the completion deadline.
    </p>
    <h4>When</h4>
    <p>
      The CAMEL and CAT decide the schedule and pace of the course. A course
      can be as flexible or as rigorous as needed or wanted, whether that
      means meeting a few hours a week or a few hours a day.
    </p>
    <h4>Where</h4>
    <p>
      The CAMEL and CAT decide the location of the meetups. Generally, people
      tend to choose coffee shops, libraries, studios, offices, or even the
      home of the CAMEL or CAT.
    </p>
    <h4>How</h4>
    <p>
      The CAMEL and CAT decide what the course will consist of and what they
      will do during meetups. Learning styles vary, so the learning methods
      and materials will be personalized to the CAMEL and the skill. Every
      course must have at least one project to be considered the capstone.
      Generally, there will also be practice projects before beginning the
      culminating capstone project, which then is broken down into milestones.
    </p>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    <p>
      Each CAMEL decides for themselves what their motivation and reasoning
      is. Typically a CAMEL is seeking to learn a new skill because they want
      to create a project, apply the skill at work, try a new hobby, get a job
      or change jobs, start a business, or just to have fun. The CAT is
      excited to help the CAMEL learn or develop a skill and complete a
      project. The CAT thrives on the connection and the opportunity to have
      an occupation in this personalized, project-based education.
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The CAMEL gets a CAT.
        <ol>
          <li>The CAMEL decides which skill to learn.</li>
          <li>
            If there is a group of CAMELs who want to learn the same skill,
            they may decide to join in the same course together.
          </li>
          <li>
            The CAMEL extends a request for a CAT (using
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdk1ZKo7POG63MzLa108wzMG_SXxEBBOO-2GDt6jqVTbaWB7g/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">the form</a>).
          </li>
          <li>The CAT accepts the request and gives an hourly rate.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Together the CAMEL and CAT define the course outline (using
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umZQojh6-1EW3Yz-FC-UQo0NgAAaLLRkc7_c1QTIi5Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the course template</a>).
        <ol>
          <li>
            Define the capstone project (although this is not always necessary
            to define right away).
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a group of CAMELs in the same course, they may decide
            to work together on one group project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define the schedule, including the timing of meetups and
            milestones.
          </li>
          <li>Pick the location of the meetups.</li>
          <li>Define practice projects and milestones.</li>
          <li>Choose learning methods and materials.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        The CAMEL takes the course and learns a new skill with the help of the
        CAT.
        <ol>
          <li>The CAMEL and CAT meet regularly at the scheduled times.</li>
          <li>
            The CAMEL completes practice projects and works on the capstone
            project (one milestone at a time).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        The CAMEL completes the capstone project by the course deadline (and
        is awarded a fun certificate from the CAT).
      </li>
      <li>
        The CAMEL presents the capstone project at a showcase celebration.
        (The CAMEL and CAT celebrate!)
